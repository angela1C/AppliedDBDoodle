- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/)
- A **document** is a record in a MongoDB collection and the basic unit of data in MongoDB.
- Documents are analogous to JSON objects or records in an relational database, consisting of {name:value} pairs.

- MongoDB stores documents in **collections** (analogous to tables in relational databases). 
- While the documents in a collection are usually similar or related to each other, they can have different fields.
- The values of fields in a document may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents. 

- If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.
- A **collection** is a group of documents (usually the documents in a collection are similar or related to each other) and is equivalent to a table in a relational database.
- There is no schema in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. Each document can store whatever is applicable to it.
- A number of **databases** can be run on a single MongoDB server.


  ## MongoDB database and collection commands.  
- `show dbs` : Show databases
- `use <db>` : Switch to a database if it exists. If it does't already exist, MongoDB creates a new database.
- `db` : to show current database (like `select database`)
- `show collections` : to show collections in the current database (like `show tables`)
- a database will not show in the list of databases returned from `show dbs` unless there is at least one document inserted into it
- `db.dropDatabase()` method to delete a database. First need to use `use <database>`  to switch to the database. 

- `db.collection_name.drop()`  to drop or delete a collection
- `db.docs.drop()` to drop a collection called docs from the current database. 

## Creating Documents:

- a document must have an `_id` field. If one isn't provided, MongoDB will automatically generate a unique one.
- The `_id` attribute ensures the uniqueness of every document.
- The `_id` cannot be an array.
- to create a document, call the `save()` method, passing in the document. 
- `db.collection.save()` where `db` is not the name of a database but refers to the current database.

- `db.collection.insert()` to add a document to a collection.
- `db.collection.insertOne()` to 

- The `save` method is actually a wrapper method which calls one of two method `insert` or `update`. 

- If you pass a document id to the `save` method where the id already exists, it overwrites the existing document. 

- `insert()` method to insert a document or documents into a collection.

- To insert multiple documents, pass them to the `insert` method in an array. (an ordered collection of data in square brackets). The attributes of each document do not have to be the same.

- `db.collection.insertOne(document)` to insert just one document into a collection

- See [`db.collection.insertMany()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/#db.collection.insertMany) for inserting multiple documents into a collection. 
- `db.collection.insertMany()` method takes an array of documents.

- `db.createCollection(name, options)` can be used to create a collection but a collection is created automatically when a document is inserted.

- `show collections `


- `db.docs.save( {_id:121, first_name : "John", surname : "Smith", email :"johnsm@gmail.com", age: 23})`

See [collection methods manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/js-collection/#collection-methods) for a list of all Mongo shell Collection methods.


# Querying the database: The `find()` method.

- `db.collection.find()` to find all documents from a collection called collection in the current database.
- equivalent to `SELECT * FROM collection`

- `db.collection.find(query, projection)`

- The `find()` method is used to query data from a MongoDB collection.
-  `db.collection.find()` method to select the documents from a collection
- The syntax of the find method is `find(query, projection)`.
-  The (optional) `query` parameter is what you are looking for - whatever documents match this query is returned. It is used to narrow down the documents returned.

- The  (optional) `projection` parameter is used to specify which fields are returned in the matching documents (similarly to `select` in MySQL)
- The first set of `{}` provided to the `find` method is the query. - The second set of `{}` is the projection.
- Both the query and projections parameters are optional.
- The `_id` field is always returned unless you specify not to.
- The **projection** determines which fields are returned in the matching documents and is also an optional parameter. (similar to `SELECT` clause in SQL.
- `find()` displays the data in an unstructured way.
- the `pretty()` method can be appended to the `find()` method to return the results in a formatted way. It spaces out name value pairs to make them easier to read by humans.

- `db.collection.find().pretty()`
- `db.collection.find({})` - to select all documents in the collection, passing in an empty document as the query filter document to the method.



- a `query` filter can be used to specify the conditions that determine which records to return.

- The `find` method finds data in a collection. If no parameters are passed (or an empty document) then all documents in the collection will be returned. State which collection and database to find the document in.

- `db.docs.find({})` where db refers to the current database, `docs` is the name of the collection to find the documents in. `find` is the name of the method.

- `db.docs.find().pretty()` 

- `db.docs.findOne()` to only return the first matching document in the database.





## Filtering queries

- The number of documents returned by a `find` can be limited by providing a query to it. The query filter document is like a smaller document. The query is provided in the first set of `{}` to the `find()` method.
- [Query filter documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#query-filter-documents) specify the conditions that determine which records to select for read, update, and delete operations.

- `<field> : <value>` expressions can be used to specify an equality condition and [query operator](expressions)

- [All operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/)

- [Update operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/%23id1)

- [Logical Query Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-logical/)

- [Comparison Query Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-comparison/)

### Equality matches.
- An equality match is specified as `{<field>:<value>}` to filter the results.
- similar to using the `WHERE` clause in SQL.
- For an equality match (i.e. <field> equals <value>), specify <field>: <value> in the query filter document and pass to the `db.collection.find()` method.

- Equality matches on the embedded document require an exact match, including the field order.
### Equality matches
- `$eq` for equality `{<key>:{$eg;<value>}}`
- `$lt` for less than `{<key>:{$lt:<value>}}`
- `$lte` less than or equal to
- `$gt` greater than
- `$gte` greater than or equal to.
- `$ne` not equal to
- `$in` check for values in an array `<key> : [<value1>, <value2>...<valueN>]
- `$nin` check for values not in an array

- See [query an array](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-arrays/). 
on how to specify an equality condition on an array using the query document { <field>: <value> } where <value> is the exact array to match, including the order of the elements.

- `db.docs.find( { colours: ["red", "green"] } )` finds all documents where the field `colours` value is an array with exactly two elements, "red" and "green", in the order as specified.

- `db.docs.find( { colours: { $all: ["red", "green"] } } )` if the order does not matter use the `$all` operator.

### Compound queries using Logical AND, OR query operators 

- These operators can be used to narrow down the results to be more specific. 
- Provide an array of name:value pairs to the `$and` and `$or` operators.
- Provide an array of values to the `$in` operator.

- As MongoDB does not have a schema, some attributes might be common to all documents in the collection but other attributes will be in some documents and not others.
- The `$exists` operator can be used to find documents with specific attributes.

- A compound query can specify conditions for more than one field in the collectionâ€™s documents.

- A logical [AND](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/#specify-and-conditions) conjunction implicitly connects the clauses of a compound query so that the query selects the documents in the collection that match all the conditions.

- can instead use the `$and` keyword and provide an array of key:value pairs.
- These two commands are equivalent:

- `db.docs.find(age:{$gt:30}, salary:{$lt:30000})`
- `db.docs.find($and:[{age:{$gt:30}}, {salary:{$lt:30000}}])`

- use the `$or` keyword to filter queries based on an OR condition.
- `$or` joins each clause with a logical OR so the query selects documents in the collection that match at least one condition.

- `db.docs.find($or:[{key1:value1}{key2:value2}])`

- `db.docs.find({ $or: [ { status: "A" }, { qty: { $lt: 30 } } ] })` to retrieve all documents in the docs collection where the status equals "A" or qty is less than ($lt) 30. (`SELECT * FROM docs WHERE status = "A" OR qty < 30`)

- AND and OR can be used together:

- `db.inventory.find( {status: "A", $or: [ { qty: { $lt: 30 } }, { item: /^p/ } })`  is the equivalent to `SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status = "A" AND ( qty < 30 OR item LIKE "p%")` in SQL.

- logical NOT: can also use the `$not` to select documents that do not match the expression provided.

- `db.docs.find( {age: { $not: { $lt: 20 } } } )` to find documents where age attribute is not less than 20. This returns documents where the age field exists and is not less than 20

- logical NOR: `$nor` to select the documents that fail all the query expressions in the array.
- `db.docs.find( { $nor: [ { price: 2.00 }, { qty: { $lt: 20 }}] } )` to select all documents where the price is not 2.00 and qty field is not less than 20 and includes documents that don't contain those fields.

- can use `$nor` with `$exists` operator to only return the documents where the fields actually exist.


### The projection parameter
- The projection determines which fields are returned in the matching documents and is also an optional parameter. 
- The projection is the set set of `{}` provided to the `find` method.
- to return only the email attribute of documents where the age is greater than 18 you supply two parameters to the find method. 

```json
db.docs.find({age: {$gt: 20}}, {email:1})
```
Here `{age: {$gt: 20}}` is the query, `{email:1}` is the projection.

- The `_id` field is always returned unless you specify not to.

- `db.docs.find({}, {_id:false, first_name:1, surname:1})`

- use `0` or `false` to not return a field
- use `1` to return a field

```json
db.users.find({}, {_id:false, first_name:1, surname:1})
```


## Examples


- `db.docs.find({Sex:"Male"})` to find all males in the collection, where males are identified by the attribute sex.

- `db.docs .find({Sex:"Male",Age:{$exists:true}})` to find all males that have an age attribute specified.

- `db.docs.find({$and:[{Sex:"Male"},{Age: {$exists:true}}]}`  is the same

- `db.docs.find({$or:[{Sex:"Female"},{$and:[{Sex:"Male"},{isStudent:true}]}]})` to find all male and female students



- `db.docs.find({age:22})` to find only documents where age is 22 use 
- To find only documents where age is 22 and _id is 1:
	* `db.docs.find({age:22, _id:1})`
	* `db.docs.find({$and: [{age:22}, {_id:1}]})`

- To find only documents where age is 22 or 30 
	* `db.docs.find({$or: [{age:22}, {age:30}]})` using the `$or` operator
- `$in` to finds any documents in the collection with the specified values provided in an array.
	* `db.docs.find({age: {$in: [22, 30]}})` 
- To find only documents that have a twitter attribute 
	* `db.docs.find({twitter: {$exists:true}})`
- To find only documents that have a twitter attribute and age is greater than 20
	* `db.docs.find({$and: [{twitter: {$exists: true}}, {age: {$gt: 20}}]})`

- `db.docs.findOne({twitter: {$exists: true}})` to find only one document that has a twitter attribute.

- `db.docs.findOne({carReg:{$exists:true}})` finds the first document in the docs collection which has a carReg attribute.

- `db.docs.find({}, {_id:false, name:1, surname:1})` to find all documents in the docs collection but only displat the name and surname fields.

- `db.docs.find( { status: { $in: [ "A", "D" ] } } )` to find documents with a stattus attribute of "A" or "D"

- `db.docs.find( { $or: [ { status: "A" }, { qty: { $lt: 30 } } ] } )`
 retrieves all documents in the collection where the status equals "A" or qty is less than ($lt) 30 and corresponds to the following SQL:

### Sort query results

- use the `sort()` method with the `find()` method.
- `db.docs.find({twitter: {$exists: true}}).sort({surname:1 , age:-1})` to sort all documents that have a twitter attribute alphabetically by surname and within surname, from oldest to youngest 
- **1** for **ascending** order, 
- **-1** for **descending** order.

***
# Update documents: `update()`

- The `save()` method replaces the existing document with the new document passed in.
- The `update()` method is used to modify existing document(s) in a collection.
- **update(query, update, options)**

- The query parameter is the first parameter passes to `update`.

- The `$set` operator is used to replace the value of a field with the set parameter. If the field does not already exist then it will add new fields with the specified values.

-  Without using the `$set` operator, the `update` command will just replace any existing attributes with the new attributes in the update command. 

- the first  `{}` to update contain the query to find the particular document to update.

- Only a single document is updated by default.

- To update an attribute for all documents in the collection can use the `update()` command and set **`multi:true`** which is the same as using the **`updateMany()`** command.

- `db.docs.update({},{$inc:{age:1}},{multi:true})` to increase all age attributes by 1. If an age attribute does not exist for a document it will add an age attribute to the document.

- `multi` can be set to true to update all documents. By default it is set to false.

- `updateMany()` does the same thing as `update()` with `multi:true`

- See also [db.collection.findOneAndUpdate](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.findOneAndUpdate/#db.collection.findOneAndUpdate) method which updates a single document based on the filter and sort criteria.

- [updateMany()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/#db.collection.updateMany) for updating all documents that match the specified filter for a collection.

- See [update operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/#update-operators) on MongodB document for list of update operators including: 

- `$set` to set the value of a field in a document
- `$unset` to remove the specified fields from a document
- `$inc` Increments the value of the field by the specified amount.
- `$rename` to rename a field
- `$mul` to multiply the value of a field by a specified amount
- `$min` to only update a field if the specified value is less than the existing value
- `$max`  to only update a field if the specified value is greater than the existing value of the field.

### Some `update()` examples: 

- `db.docs.update({_id:1}, {carReg:"10-G-9876"})` would replace the entire document with _id of 1 with {carReg:"10-G-9876"}

- `db.docs.update({_id:1},{$set:{carReg:"191-K-4"}})` using the `$set` operator would update the document with the new attribute and not overwrite the other attributes. 

- `db.docs.update( {$or: [{name:"Tom"}, {name:"Mary"}]}, {$set:{address: "Galway"}}, {multi:true})`

- `db.docs.update( {experience: {$gt:20}}, {$set: {title:"Manager"}}, {multi:true, upsert:true})`

- `db.docs.save({_id:"O477", Name:"Billy",Age:29, email:"billy477@gmail.com"})` to add a new document.

- `db.people.update({_id:"O477"},{$set:{twitter:"@billy477"}})` to find the document with this id and update or add a new attribute.

- `db.docs.update({_id:106}, {$set:{fname:"Sean",Surname:"Byrne",age:33,email:"seanb1@yahoo.com"}}` to update several attributes at the same time

- `db.docs.update({},{$inc:{age:1}})` only update the first age in the first document.

- `db.docs.update({age:{$exists:true}},{$inc:{age:1}},{multi:true})` would update all age attributes by 1. if the field does not exist in a document, it will add the attribute to the document.

- `db.docs.update({},{$max:{age:31}},{multi:true})` would update the age attribute to 31 if the existing value is less than 31

- `db.docs.updateMany({_id:{$in:[101,102,103,105,106,107]}},{$set:{sex:"M"}})` would update any of the documents matching the _id attribute provided in the array provided to the `$in` operator.

- `db.docs.updateMany({sex:{$ne:"M"}},{$set:{sex:"F"}})` would update the sex attribute to "M" where it was not already equal to "M". 

- `db.docs.updateMany({$and:[{sex:"M"},{age:{$gt:20}}]},{$set:{title:"Mr. "}})` to add a new title attribute with the value Mr., to each document where the sex is M, and the age is greater than 20.

- `db.docs.updateMany({},{$rename:{fname:"Name"}})` `$rename` to rename the fname attribute to Name.

- `db.docs.update({$or:[{_id:101},{_id:103},{_id:107}]},{$unset:{carReg:""}},{multi:true})`  will remove the carReg attribute from the documents with either of these _id's.

- `db.docs.update({},{$unset:{days:""}},{multi:true})`
*** 

# Delete documents

- `deleteOne()` removes a single document from a collection that matches the filter.
- `deleteMany()` removes all documents that match the filter from a collection.

- See [db.collection.remove()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.remove/#db-collection-remove) method to remove a document from a collection which takes a query document and an option `justOne` boolean

- `db.collection.remove(<query>,<justOne>)`
- To limit the removal to just one document, set the optional `justOne` parameter to `true`. (default valus is `false`.)

- `db.docs.remove( { } )` will remove all documents from the docs collection
- `db.docs.remove( { qty: { $gt: 20 } } )` to remove all documents where the qty field is greater than 20
